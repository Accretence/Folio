I'm Amirhossein Mohammadi, a self-taught developer & an architecture undergraduate. I work at the intersection of programming and design. In my spare time I try to work on open-source projects. Most of my open-source projects below 👇🏻 are focused on one thing - **make deploying practical production apps faster & more efficient**!
