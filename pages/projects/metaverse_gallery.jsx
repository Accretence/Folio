                <p className="text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300">
                    Grasshopper is a graphical algorithm editor tightly
                    integrated with Rhinoâ€™s 3-D modeling tools. The program was
                    created by David Rutten at Robert McNeel & Associates.
                    Programs are created by dragging components onto a canvas.
                    The outputs to these components are then connected to the
                    inputs of subsequent components, allowing designers to build
                    form generators from the simple to the awe-inspiring.
