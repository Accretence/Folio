                            There is an inherent need for communities to be
                            organized about a center for its own political and
                            social welfare and expression. To peer into its own
                            mind and life, to discover its own social needs and
                            then to meet them, whether they concern communal
                            decision making, health, recreation, education or
                            industry; such community organization is necessary
                            if a society is to flourish. This thesis tries to
                            create an architectural design methodology to help
                            answer these needs and to help rebuild the
                            compromised, depleted and dilapidated urban,
                            societal and ecological infrastructures in our
                            cities. A Design Methodology to transpire a
                            transparent relationship between the communities
                            (and their representative community based

                            A Growing number of ecological dangers are
                            threatening our communities and cities. A disconnect
                            between our communities and the knowledge of
                            countless immense infrastructures implemented to
                            make modern living possible is making these threats
                            all the more real.

                            Based on presented information, there is a need for
                            center in neighbourhoods and communities to enable
                            them to gather about a center for them to flourish.
                            The Quality and properties of the building should
                            reflect this concept and enable itâ€™s community to
                            connect and learn.
