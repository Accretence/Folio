                                    There is an inherent need for communities to
                                    be organized about a center for its own
                                    political and social welfare and expression.
                                    To peer into its own mind and life, to
                                    discover its own social needs and then to
                                    meet them, whether they concern communal
                                    decision making, health, recreation,
                                    education or industry; such community
                                    organization is necessary if a society is to
                                    flourish. This thesis tries to create an
                                    architectural design methodology to help
                                    answer these needs and to help rebuild the

                                    Based on presented information, there is a
                                    need for center in neighbourhoods and
                                    communities to enable them to gather about a
                                    center for them to flourish. The Quality and
                                    properties of the building should reflect
                                    this concept and enable itâ€™s community to
                                    connect and learn.
