                                    Discord is a messaging application based
                                    around self-contained & private messaging
                                    boards (called <b>Guilds</b>) each with
                                    their own subset of rules and hierarchies.
                                    Discord was initially for gamers to connect
                                    and play along and for joining gaming
                                    communities. It has voice channels so that
                                    players can play along. But Discord has
                                    changed a lot and people use Discord for
                                    general purposes and not just gaming!

                                    One important factor of Discord is bots. The
                                    automated bots power the guilds and make it
                                    even more interactive and easy to manage.
                                    Any Discord based community is difficult to
                                    exist without bots. Bots can play any role
                                    in the server, they can be used as a support
                                    bot or a moderation bot which will look
                                    closely at the userâ€™s activities in the
                                    server and warn them on any violation of
                                    rules without any need for moderators
                                    getting involved.
